# matplotlib-life

This repo contains a script that can render Conway's Game of Life, along with some previous versions/predecessors. The purpose of the visualizer is for students in Harvey Mudd College's CS5 course to use when completing a homework assignment. This assignment asks them to implement the rules of Conway's Game of Life, and the main file of this repo allows them to see what happens when their rules are applied. 

## Dependencies

These scripts are all written in Python 3, and require the numpy and matplotlib libraries (both of which are included in the Anaconda distribution)

## How to Run

Make sure hw9pr1_matplotlibgraphics.py is in the same directory as hw9pr1.py. Then open a terminal window and cd into the directory where these files are, and enter `python3 hw9pr1_matplotlibgraphics.py`.
- unpause/pause/play by pressing the spacebar
- reset by pressing return/enter
- step forward by pressing 'n' (for next step)
